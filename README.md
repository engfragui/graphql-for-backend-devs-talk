# A GraphQL guide for backend developers

Slides presented at the SFNode meetup in March 2019.

## Talk abstract

There’s a lot of information out there about GraphQL, and most of it focuses on the benefits that this technology brings to developers building web and mobile applications.

But wait. What about backend developers? How do things look from their perspective? Can GraphQL help them be more efficient and improve their day-to-day work?

In this talk, I would like to illustrate some of the benefits (and the not-so-good parts) of GraphQL from the perspective of a backend developer like myself, and also share some of the lessons and best practices I’ve learned while working with GraphQL.

At the end, you’ll want to try GraphQL out if you haven’t done so already, and you’ll also be able to convince your backend developer friends to do the same!
